                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <h2>General</h2>
                <p>
                    The inevitable Terms of Use. We don't like them either, but they are a necessity when being professional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mind42 is a service provided by IRIAN Solutions Softwareentwicklungs- und Beratungsgesellschaft mbH (in short terms “IRIAN”), Schottenfeldgasse 20/6a, 1070 Vienna, Austria, Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any service provided by IRIAN and your use of those services is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between IRIAN and you. The principal place of business for IRIAN is the company’s address mentioned above. This descriptive writing explains how the agreement is set up and describes some of the underlying terms of agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document reflects a minimum set of terms and conditions that always apply unless otherwise agreed in writing with IRIAN.
                </p>

                <h2>Accepting the Terms of Service</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to use the service you must first agree to the Terms of Service (in short terms “ToS”). If you not accept the ToS you may not use the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking to agree accepts the ToS. This option is made available to the graphical user interface of the service provided. Furthermore you accept the ToS by actually using the service. This means that IRIAN treats your use of the service as acceptance of the ToS from that point onwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should print or save a copy of the ToS for your records.
                </p>

                <h2>Service provisioning</h2>
                <p>
                    IRIAN itself or partners of IRIAN will provide services to you. Usually services are provided by IRIAN itself. In the case of a provided service by a partner you acknowledge and agree that IRIAN partners will be entitled to provide those services to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Services provided by IRIAN are subject to a continuous development process.

Furthermore you acknowledge and agree that IRIAN may stop permanently or temporarily to provide the entire service or parts and features of the service to you or in generally to all users of the service at any time. If you’re stopping to use services provided by IRIAN you do not need to explicitly inform IRIAN.

                <p>
                    IRIAN gives you a personal, worldwide valid, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use software by IRIAN as part of a service provided by IRIAN to you. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use services – service/software as it is - provided by IRIAN, in the manner permitted by the ToS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not copy, modify, derivate the work or reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the service provided by IRIAN, unless you have been explicitly permitted in writing by IRIAN or it is required by law. Furthermore you may not permit anyone else to act instead of you. If you have received a written permission by IRIAN to do so, you may not assign your rights to use the software (the extracted code), grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the software or transfer otherwise any part of your rights to use the extracted software.
                </p>

                <h2>Service updates</h2>
                <p>
                    Services provided by IRIAN rely on software written by IRIAN and/or third parties. From time to time updates must be applied.

                </p>

                <h2>Ending your relationship with services provided by IRIAN</h2>
                <p>
                    The ToS will continue to apply until terminated by either IRIAN or you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can terminate your legal agreement with IRIAN by notifying IRIAN at any time or by removing or disabling your service registration. You should send your notification in writing to IRIAN’s address mentioned in the beginning of this document or by using contact or feedback forms provided by the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IRIAN may at any time terminate its legal agreement with you if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>you have breached any provision of the ToS</li>
                        <li>IRIAN is required to do so by law</li>
                        <li>a partner of IRIAN has stopped to offer services which build the base of the provided services by IRIAN to you</li>
                        <li>IRIAN has decided to no longer publicly provide the service at all.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When these ToS come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that IRIAN and you have benefit from, been subject to or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation and the provisions of chapter “Jurisdiction” shall continue to apply indefinitely.
                </p>

                <h2>Software and License in local environments</h2>
                <p>
                    Some software applications and solutions by IRIAN may also be operated locally. Locally means in such a case: within your environment, on your own responsibility and power, as virtual appliance and on the basis of an exclusive license issued by IRIAN to you. Such a license is granted under this agreement - as part of the general ToS - solely to you as licensee and not by implication or otherwise to any parent, subsidiary or affiliate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are not allowed to assign, sell, rent, lease, transfer, resell, redistribute or sublicense the software to any third party unless otherwise agreed to in writing with IRIAN in its sole discretion. You agree not to copy the virtual appliance or the software in whole or in part or to extract the software from the underlaying virtual environment, except that you make copies of the local running environment for backup and archive purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not modify the software, make derivative works based on the software or the underlaying virtual environment or try to merge the delivered environment with other computer programs and solutions. You are not allowed to reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the software in whole or in part or otherwise to attempt to derive its source code. This restriction may conflict with software or licenses additionally delivered as part of the virtual appliance and applies to software written by IRIAN which is part of the virtual appliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree not to modify, obscure or delete any proprietary rights notices included in the software, within the virtual appliance or the documentation. Furthermore you agree to include all such notices on all copies – if explicitly permitted by IRIAN.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The license granted to you under this agreement is limited to the number of seats/registrations set forth during the download, purchase and/or installation process. Only one person may use a seat/registration. Two or more people may not share a seat/registration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally you agree to use the software and the virtual appliance in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, applicable export control laws and regulations of Austria, Europe and their jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p>
                    The ToS and your relationship with IRIAN shall be governed by the law of Austria, Europe without regard to its conflict of laws provisioned by your country. IRIAN and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state Austria, Europe to resolve any legal matter arising from the ToS.
                </p>

                <h2>Changes to the ToS</h2>
                <p>
                    IRIAN may change the ToS from time to time. When changes have been made a new version of the ToS will be available at <a href="http://www.mind42.com/terms" target="_blank">http://www.mind42.com/terms</a> or <a href="http://www.irian.at/terms" target="_blank">http://www.irian.at/terms</a>. You understand and agree that if you use services provided by IRIAN after the date on which the ToS have changed that IRIAN will treat your use of the service as acceptance of the ToS. Furthermore you agree that IRIAN may provide notices including changes to the ToS by email, regular mail or as a post/reminder within the service.
